My personal setup on my laptop.
Uses i3 and polybar. Will try to add more information later.

Kbd_backlight is a script that will turn my keyboard backlighting on/off. You can use this for your machine but it will need modifications


i3 config is mostly vanilla except for the polybar and custom macros I put in.
